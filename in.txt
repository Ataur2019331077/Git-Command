In the realm of modern software development, effective version control is paramount.

First go to your <a href="https://github.com/">github</a>. profile. Then create a new repository.

Now open your terminal and go the directory where you want to clone this project.
h5:
Now you will use your first git command. Get ready.
code:
git clone
p:
This command will clone the project that you have just created on github some moment ago.
h5:
Now you can add files and project files on this directory.
h5:
To include new files or changed files in the directory you need to run the below command:
code:
git add .
h5:
If you want to save specific files
code:
git add file_name1 file name2
h5:
To save the files locally run the command.
code:
git commit -m "initial commit"
p:
here "initial commit" is the message to show what you have changed. Here you can write whatever you want.
h5:
Now we will connect remotely this directory to github directory
code:
git add remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
p:
https://github.com/username/repository.git is the same link that you copied for clone the project.
h5:
It's time to upload the files into github repository.
You can do this by run the command below
code:
git push -u origin master
h5:
It will upload on your master branch.
However if you want to change your branch you can run the command and then you can push.
code:
git checkout -b main

h5:
If there is conflict in your local files with github repository files then <b>push</b> command will not work properly.
However, if you want to upload your files forcibly, then run the code below.
code:
git push -f origin main
h5:
In conclusion, mastering these essential Git commands equips you with the necessary tools to efficiently manage your projects, collaborate seamlessly, and navigate the world of version control with confidence. Happy coding!
